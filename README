OK this is a quick and dirty partial port of Mikeal Rogers request node module
https://github.com/mikeal/request

The aim is to build a browser side, framework independent, partial implementation of his library so that I can create isomorphic http apis. Such as a js couchdb api that will work seemlessly on both node.js and in the browser.

You'll need to include json2.js included in the lib directory to support older browsers.

I haven't tested IE yet so please don't use in production yet.

At present this type of simple request is supported:

request({
	url : serverDb + testDb,
	method : 'put',
	body : '{"name":"Tom"}',
	json : true
}, function(error, response, body) {
	// Your callback code here
});
