OK this is a quick and dirty partial port of Mikeal Rogers request node module
https://github.com/mikeal/request

The aim is to build a browser side framework implementation of his library. 

At present this type of simple request is supported:

request({
			url : serverDb + testDb,
			method : 'put',
			body : '{"name":"Tom"}',
			json : true
		}, function(error, response, body) {
			// Your callback code here
		});
